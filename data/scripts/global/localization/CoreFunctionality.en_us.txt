$q0001:       Talk to Joe
$q0002:       I've bought an old civilian shuttle and finally left my home planet. However, it won't take me far. Now I should head to the nearest space station and look for One-Eyed Joe. I've heard he's helping beginners figure out how things work. He should be inside the station on one of the decks.
