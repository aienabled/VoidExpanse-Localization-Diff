$p0001:             Uh-oh, Batto sent you? I'm so screwed...
$p0002:             Well, I was transporting some stuff for Batto, like always. But suddenly those guys from the Order showed up. So I panicked, okay?
$p0003:             I tried to drop my cargo and leave, but those guys shot a couple of rockets at me. They damaged my engines. So now I'm stuck here.
$p0004:             Oh, well... about that... It's a matter of perspective...
$p0005:             Well, yeah! So what? Big surprise. Half of Freedom traders are smugglers.
$p0006:             Will you help me or not?
$p0007:             Go to Batto, tell him I need a repair kit for my vessel, and then bring it to me. I will fix my ship and return to Batto.
$p0008:             Oh, that was a joke? Heh, you're a real comedian.
$p0009:             You want to talk NOW?! Kill these aliens before they get us both!
$p0010:             God damn it. That was close! You showed up just in time or those Xengatarn would have torn my ship apart!
$p0011:             Did you bring me the repair kit?
$p0012:             Thank you! I'll fix my engine now and be at Batto's in no time!
$p0013:             You can go to him and tell him the good news. I hope you didn't mention anything about the cargo...
$p0014:             My friend's vessel lost signal not so far away from here. It would be a good idea to go check on him.
$p0015:             Are you up for this?
$p0016:             We'll see about that when the task is done.
$p0017:             Watch your back.
$p0018:             Here's his last known coordinates. Make sure he gets here in one piece.
$p0019:             Anything to report?
$p0020:             Damaged? I see. What about his cargo?
$p0021:             I see. Thank you for your honesty.
$p0022:             I will deal with Declan as soon as he comes back.
$p0023:             That is suspicious.
$p0024:             Okay, here's your repair kit. Bring it to Declan. He will know what to do with it.
$p0025:             Good work.
$p0026:             Yes? Anything else?
$p0027:             Yes, I think you do.
$p0028:             Here.
$c0001:             What happened?
$c0002:             I don't understand. Why did you panic? You did nothing wrong.
$c0003:             Let me guess. You were smuggling stolen goods?
$c0004:             How can I help?
$c0005:             Okay, I'll do it. Don't go anywhere.
$c0006:             Here it is.
$c0007:             What do I get in return?
$c0008:             Okay, I'm in.
$c0009:             Maybe next time.
$c0010:             Declan's ship was damaged. He needs a repair kit.
$c0011:             He dropped it.
$c0012:             I know nothing about that.
$c0013:             ...
$c0014:             Don't I deserve some kind of reward or something?
$t0001:             Need help?
$t0002:             Found Declan
$t0003:             Helped Declan
$t0004:             Batto sent me
$t0005:             What happened?
$q0001:             Batto's friend
$q0002:             I need to get back to Batto and ask for a repair kit for Declan.
$q0003:             I've brought the repair kit to Declan. He will fix his ship and return to Batto. I should tell this to Batto.
$q0004:             Mercenary Batto sent me to help his friend, who is obviously in trouble. I need to proceed to the %system% system and find him.
$q0005:             Batto gave me the repair kit. Now I should bring it back to Declan.
$q0006:             I've destroyed the Xengatarn ships that attacked Declan.
$i0001:             Declan
$i0002:             Xengatarn
