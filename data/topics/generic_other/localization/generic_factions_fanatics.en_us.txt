$p0001:             Is there anything in particular you want to know about the Fanatics?
$p0002:             Our history doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is what we do.
$p0003:             Well, as I've heard, after the Lockdown some people started going crazy. The Order and Freedom gathered them together and sent them away to some planet. That's pretty much all I know.
$p0004:             I think they're a bunch of madmen. Collecting Xengatarn guts and... who knows what else they're doing.
$p0005:             I'm trying not to think about them. At least they don't interfere with us.
$p0006:             In our faction we are brothers and sisters, united by a common purpose.
$p0007:             Well, honestly, I don't know what to think.
$p0008:             Hiring? Such a vulgar world. We are a brotherhood, not a bunch of mercs. If you want to become one of us, speak to Guardian Dostan. He will decide whether you're worthy to join us or not.
$p0009:             You can find Guardian Dostan on station %station% in the %system% system.
$p0010:             You're already one of us.
$p0011:             You are already in a faction. I don't think you can join another one.
$p0012:             Well, Fanatics are a rather closed community. I've never heard of anyone joining them willingly. Besides, they won't let you close - as I've heard, they're blasting any stranger approaching them.
$p0013:             But I've heard that some of the Freedom faction actually trade with them. They might know more. Ask them.
$p0014:             Oh, they ARE hiring. You just need to know the right approach.
$p0015:             Well, personally I don't know anything about it. But I've heard that Mannis, a broker on one of our stations, has some sort of business with them. He may know something. You can find him on %station% in the %system% system.
$p0016:             You are already in a faction. I don't think you can join another one.
$c0001:             What's the history of the Fanatics?
$c0002:             What do you think of the Fanatics?
$c0003:             Are the Fanatics hiring?
$c0004:             Nevermind.
$c0005:             I'd like to ask one more thing...
$c0006:             That's all I needed to know.
$c0007:             I'd like to ask one more thing...
$c0008:             That's all I needed to know.
$c0009:             I'd like to ask one more thing...
$c0010:             That's all I needed to know.
$q0001:             Join Fanatics
$q0002:             If I want to join the Fanatics, I need to talk to Broker Mannis. He's on %station% in the %system% system.
