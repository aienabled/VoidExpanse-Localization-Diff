$p0001:             The Suppression Force was a large fleet of modern human ships sent here to deal with the Xengatarn threat. There was a huge battle over the border of the Far Colonies. Our fleet was almost entirely destroyed.
$p0002:             Well, I don't know for sure but it seems that our forces were overwhelmed. The Xengatarn somehow built thousands of ships in less than a few years. The Suppression Force destroyed most of them, but at the cost of losing the entire fleet and any further chance of winning this war.
$c0001:             How did it happen?
