$p0001:             Sure, kid. Ask away!
$p0002:             Not at all, kid!
$p0003:             Why, I'm nothing... Just a shadow. But there was a time when I meant something, you know. Joseph Hawkes, Federation General, a hero. So proud of myself I was…
$p0004:             I was in command of the Northern Wing of the Suppression Force the Federation sent to fight the aliens, you know. We gathered all of our strength, all these... shiny new big ships and everything.
$p0005:             That bastard Troyden sent us out there to be slaughtered. These... creatures... tore apart our ships. Nothing dangerous he said. Trustworthy intelligence, mindless xen life form, he said.
$p0006:             Two of my sons were there, you know. Both died in the first five minutes of battle.
$p0007:             I wanted to die there too. But this one little thing called EEHC - 'emergency evacuation of high commanders' didn't let me... You know how it works? An entire command bridge disconnects from the mothership and automatically launches back to safety.
$p0008:             I couldn't even die with my sons. That's my reward for 40 years of service in the damned Federation. Screw it.
$p0009:             I just walked in and sat on this chair.
$p0010:             One day I was really hungry, so I ate it with pepper and soya sauce.
$p0011:             Of course I lost it in battle! Any more stupid questions?
$p0012:             Curious about the Xengatarn, huh? I bet you didn't have a chance to satisfy your hunger for information on your farmer's planet down there, did you? The Federation's policy is strict about telling civilians the REAL news. They prefer to feed you with distorted crap.
$p0013:             Well, I think people should know what's really going on.
$p0014:             The Xengatarn are a species that we came across while exploring this part of the galaxy. A couple of planets with a low-grade organic civilization. Their technology, as far as I can see, is partially biological - their ships look like something alive. Well, I'm no scientist, you know.
$p0015:             As I know it, they suddenly became aggressive and destroyed our drones and jumpgate. The Federation considered the aliens a threat, even gave them their name - Xengatarn, which means something like 'outside aggressor'. Shortly after, the Federation decided to wipe them out. 'For the sake of humanity', ha-ha-ha...
$p0016:             Next? The Federation sent a new jumpgate there. It took almost 3 years to deliver it by our carrier ships. Our squadron jumped in. They thought they'd kill them with just one squadron.
$p0017:             Next thing we know - thousands of Xengatarn ships came out of our jumpgate and attacked the Far Colonies, spreading across the galaxy like a plague. From our jumpgates. Ironic, huh?
$p0018:             We just couldn't believe they'd build such a huge armada in 3 years. We thought we'd squish them with our thumb. Humanity is so arrogant.
$p0019:             The Federation had sent a so called Suppression Force - a large armada of our newest ships, some of them even built with the help of Nharmars. Unfortunately, even the help of our alien friends wasn't enough - our armada was almost totally destroyed. Only a few small squadrons survived.
$p0020:             Then, the Lockdown was initiated - and we were left face to face with the Xengatarn. It's like we were locked in a cage with a tiger. You know he'd eventually eat you. It's only a matter of time... You've heard of tigers, right? They are from Earth. Is there a school on this farming planet of yours? No offense, kid.
$c0001:             Who are you?
$c0002:             What happened to your eye?
$c0003:             What do you know about aliens?
$c0004:             Thank you for your help!
$c0005:             Seems like you took your defeat personally.
$c0006:             How did you end up here?
$c0007:             I wanted to ask about something else...
$c0008:             Thank you for your help!
$c0009:             I wanted to ask about something else...
$c0010:             I wanted to ask about something else...
$c0011:             Thank you for your help!
$c0012:             What happened next?
$c0013:             I wanted to ask about something else...
$c0014:             Thank you for your help!
$c0015:             What happened next?
$c0016:             I wanted to ask about something else...
