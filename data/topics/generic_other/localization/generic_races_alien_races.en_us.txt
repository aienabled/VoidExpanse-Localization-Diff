$p0001:             I can tell you a bit about the known alien races.
$p0002:             Well, of course you've heard of the Xengatarn - a plague of the Far Colonies. There are also Nharmars - a technologically advanced race and our ally.
$p0003:             And, of course, we cannot forget about the Ergreks. They are a long extinct race on whose technology humanity based their most precious invention – jumpgates.
$p0004:             There are also several so called \"minor races\".
