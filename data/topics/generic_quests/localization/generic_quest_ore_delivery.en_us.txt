$p0001:             Some of our equipment needs repair but we don't have enough materials and our miners are working slowly because of the pirates.
$p0002:             We need 150 pieces of glepsite ore. I will pay 2000d, which is much more than you'll get in a store for that amount.
$p0006:             By the way, if your cargo space is less than 150, just transfer the ore that you have into Station Storage. I can also take the ore from there. Then you can go back out and gather more.
$p0003:             I thought we had a deal. I need no less than 150 pieces. You can count, I assume? Come back when you've gathered enough glepsite.
$p0004:             Good job! Now we can finally complete our repairs. Here is your money.
$p0005:             Ore? But we don't need ore right now... Maybe you got this order on another station?
$q0001:             Ore supply
$q0002:             I need to get 150 pieces of glepsite ore to station %station% in the %system% system.
$q0003:             If my cargo space is not large enough, I can store the ore in the station's storage bay. The station commander will take the ore from there.
