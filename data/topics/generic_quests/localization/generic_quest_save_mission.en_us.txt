$p0001:             One of our civilian transport ships was ambushed by pirates. You need to go to the crash site and look for survivors.
$p0002:             There was a large-scale battle between our patrols and pirates not too far from here. Some of our ships were destroyed, and we believe there are survivors.
$p0003:             Not so long ago our patrols destroyed a pirate ship smuggling slaves. We do not tolerate slavery, so it was... disabled. Some of the slaves were killed by pirates, but some of them seem to have survived this confrontation.
$p0004:             Our scanners are picking up life signs in the wreckage. You must go there and extract the survivors. Hurry, their life signs are getting weaker every moment!
$p0005:             And be sure you have enough space for them in your ship.
$p0006:             Why are you still here? Our people are dying while you are just standing there doing nothing!
$p0007:             Rescue mission? Never heard of it. You probably took it on another station.
$p0008:             You've saved all of them! Good job! We'll take care of them from here.
$p0009:             Here is your reward, hero!
$p0010:             Bounty contract? Never heard of it. Maybe it was issued on another station?
$q0001:             Save mission
$q0002:             I should go to the location of the ship's wreckage in the %system% system and save %quantity% survivors.
$q0003:             I've rescued the survivors from the wreckage, now I need to get them back to the station safely.
$n0001:             Not enough room
$n0002:             You need at least %survivorsQuantity% free slots in your inventory to take on the survivors.
