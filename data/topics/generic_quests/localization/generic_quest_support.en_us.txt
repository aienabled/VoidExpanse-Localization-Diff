$p0001:             This job is simple. We have a freighter, loaded with very important cargo. You need to escort it to station %station% in the %system% system.
$p0002:             Lead the way. The freighter will just follow you. Now go, time is precious!
$p0003:             You got your job. The freighter is waiting for you outside this station.
$p0004:             You delivered the freighter in one piece! Nicely done!
$p0005:             Here's your reward. Try not to spend everything at once, will you?
