$p0001:             But your fuel tank is already full.
$p0002:             Sure, I can spare some fuel. I could refuel your ship for %money%d. Deal?
$p0003:             You blew your reputation with the Order. Do you really think I will help you? Do something useful for the Order first. Then we'll talk.
$p0004:             You blew your reputation with Freedom. Jeredan doesn't trust you anymore. Do something useful for Freedom first, then we'll talk.
$p0005:             Our Brotherhood doesn't trust you yet. And that is all I need to know. Try doing something useful for our faction, and we can talk then.
$p0006:             Hey! Are you trying to trick me? You don't have enough money!
$p0007:             ...
$p0008:             Here you go. I've transfered the fuel. Safe travels!
$p0009:             Suit yourself.
$c0001:             Deal.
$c0002:             No, that's too much.
