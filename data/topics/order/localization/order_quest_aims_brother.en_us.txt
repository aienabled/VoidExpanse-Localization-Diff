$p0001:             Who wants to know?
$p0002:             Suit yourself.
$p0003:             I see... I could use your help, actually.
$p0004:             I have a brother. He was a soldier just like me, but after Troyden's defeat he lost faith in our cause and joined the Freedom mercenaries.
$p0005:             I haven't heard from him in a while. Can you look for him and make sure he's alright?
$p0006:             Well, the last I heard he was in the %system% system.
$p0007:             And one more thing...
$p0008:             Can you tell him that he's a moron and a dirty traitor? That would mean a lot to me.
$p0009:             You've brought his report? Great! Thank you.
$p0010:             It's unfortunate that our courier was killed. It's hard to find trustworthy men nowadays.
$p0011:             Speaking of trustworthiness, you've proved your loyalty to me and to the Order. I offer you my reward and full support. If you ever need anything - come see me.
$p0012:             Ehm... I don't know what you're talking about. I have no brother.
$p0013:             Yeah, you probably did.
$p0014:             Well, I know nothing about that. I told you I don't have a brother. Got it?
$p0015:             Stop shouting!
$p0016:             So, you're really from Broderick? Good. I haven't heard from him in a while. Our courier was killed by pirates a couple of weeks ago.
$p0017:             Because I'm working undercover here, you genius! And it's better that no one knows that I still keep in touch with my brother.
$p0018:             It was Broderick's idea. That was our password when we were children and played online games.
$p0019:             Okay, take my report and give it to my brother. Here. Safe travels!
$p0020:             I TOLD YOU I DON'T HAVE A BROTHER! NOW, GET LOST!
$c0001:             I'm just an adventurer passing by.
$c0002:             I want to join the Order.
$c0003:             I'm %name%.
$c0004:             Sure, it doesn't seem too hard. Where can I find him?
$c0005:             Maybe another time.
$c0006:             What?
$c0007:             That can't be right! I was sent by your brother to find you!
$c0008:             You're a moron and a traitor!
$c0009:             Oh, sorry... I've probably confused you with someone else.
$c0010:             You're a moron and a traitor!
$c0011:             Oh, sorry... I've probably confused you with someone else
$c0012:             Why all the secrecy?
$c0013:             And that phrase about morons and traitors?
$t0001:             Need help?
$t0002:             Your brother
$t0003:             Your brother
$q0001:             Building bridges
$q0002:             Officer Aims asked me to find his brother, who is currently in the Freedom capital, %system%.
$q0003:             I brought Mercenary Aims' report back to his brother and received my reward.
$q0004:             Officer Aims' brother, who is working undercover as an informant in the Freedom faction, gave me his report. I should bring it back to his brother... probably.
