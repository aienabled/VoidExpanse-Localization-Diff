$p0001:             Well, if you're looking for an opportunity to serve the Order - good for you! I've heard, that Sgt. Ragnar is looking for fearless fighters for a dangerous task.
$p0002:             Do you think you're up for it? Well, if you are, I think you should go straight to him.
$p0003:             Hmmm. You've proven yourself as a loyal soldier. Perhaps you can be of greater use to us?
$p0004:             Go and talk to our leader, General Troyden. I'll grant you access to the Command Deck.
$p0005:             Dismissed.
$p0006:             So, Sgt. Ragnar sent YOU. Let me look at your face.
$p0007:             I see bravery and courage. I see loyalty and wisdom. Yes, you're the kind of person I need for this job.
$p0008:             For some time now we've been gathering our forces for retaliation. We're stronger then ever, especially with all the intel and knowledge we've been gathering. Now we're finally ready to attack the Xengatarn. But there's one little problem.
$p0009:             We cannot reach Xengatarn space. They are somehow disrupting our jumpgates, and we cannot use them to travel anymore.
$p0010:             When our forces were defeated and we retreated, the Xengatarn occupied a large sector of the Far Colonies. We have no idea what's going on in the occupied area, and we cannot find out.
$p0011:             It appears that the Xengatarn did something to some of our jumpgates. Now they allow only the Xengatarn ships to traverse them, but not ours. I'm no tech expert, but, according to our scientists, there's some sort of scrambler on the other side which is blocking our transportation.
$p0012:             So, as you can see, we have a problem that needs to be solved. Our engineers and scientists have achieved almost no results in this matter.
$p0013:             Indeed, you're not! Ha-ha.
$p0014:             There's a different approach I'd like to try. Recently a rumor reached my ears, that one of the Freedom mercs, Marion, was able to successfully travel through a Xengatarn infested jumpgate.
$p0015:             Of course, he was immediately killed by the Xengatarn, so we cannot exactly ask him how he managed to pull this off.
$p0016:             Not quite. As we know, Marion spent a lot of time on one independent station outside of Freedom territory. With a guy called Barrich.
$p0017:             It's a nickname. I believe his real name is Boris Richevskiy. He was a brilliant physicist back in the Federation days.
$p0018:             But this information is not of much importance to you. What you need to know is where to find him.
$p0019:             Correct.
$p0020:             And this is actually your task. Find this Barrich, then find a way to travel through the blocked jumpgates. Then come back to me.
$p0021:             Our intelligence indicates he's somewhere in the %system% system.
$p0022:             Remember: this is a task of crucial importance. You must prevail.
$p0023:             Any results with this Barrich? Have you found a way to travel through the blocked jumpgates yet?
$p0024:             No? As I've already said, this is a task of crucial importance. Put all your effort into it.
$p0025:             Any results with Barrich? Have you found a way to travel through the blocked jumpgates yet?
$p0026:             Device? Hmm, that's interesting...
$p0027:             Well, if it worked for that merc Marion - it will work for us, right?
$p0029:             Good job! Here take some cash as a reward. Now we can finally travel to Xengatarn space!
$p0030:             Note: You are playing a multiplayer game you can only complete the entire story in singleplayer game! And now you are free to continue the game in sandbox mode.
$p0028:             Good job! Here, take some cash as a reward. And I have more tasks for you.
$c0001:             What job?
$c0002:             What problem?
$c0003:             Tell me more about the broken jumpgates.
$c0004:             Go on.
$c0005:             Please continue.
$c0006:             But what can I do? I'm not a scientist.
$c0007:             So, the situation is hopeless then?
$c0008:             Tell me more about this Barrich.
$c0009:             I need to find him, right?
$c0010:             I've got this device...
$t0001:             Duties
$t0002:             Duties
$t0003:             Barrich
$t0004:             Duties
$q0001:             My Duties at the Order
$q0002:             My Duties at the Order
$q0003:             I've been told that Sgt. Ragnar is looking for good pilots for a dangerous task. Maybe I should offer him my service... He's on station %station% in the %system% system.
$q0004:             I should talk to General Troyden, the leader of the Order. He's in the %system% system, on station %station%.
$q0005:             General Troyden gave me a task to find Barrich in the %system% system and find a way to travel through the blocked jumpgates.
$q0006:             I've delivered Barrich's device to General Troyden. He was very pleased with my work.
$q0007:             I've got the device that allows travel through the blocked jumpgates. I should bring it to General Troyden at station %station% in the %system% system.
