$p0001:             Speak to Lobino. He's in charge here.
$p0002:             Finally, you've arrived. You're late!
$p0003:             What? Nevermind
$p0004:             Tell me the password and let's get this over with.
$p0005:             WHAT?
$p0006:             You're not Bruno! You're an imposter!
$p0007:             Get him, boys!
$p0008:             Hell of a fight, huh? Nice work!
$p0009:             Look inside the wreckages. Maybe the kidnapped storekeeper is still alive?
$p0010:             You've rescued the kidnapped guy? Great! Get him back to the station and talk to Officer Gorth.
$p0011:             Help? From you? Ha-ha-ha-ha....
$p0012:             You can't even help yourself! What are you doing here?! Looking for trouble?
$p0013:             You know what? If I were you, I'd hide at home until this war is over. It's tough out there.
$p0014:             Ha-ha-ha! I like it! If you can't stand up for yourself, then you won't survive. Am I right?
$p0015:             If we'd met under different circumstances, I'd buy you a beer. But now I have work to do.
$p0016:             I'm looking for kidnappers. Last night three pirates broke into the store on this station and kidnapped our storekeeper. Probably wanted security codes or something.
$p0017:             Now these scumbags want to sell him to slavers...
$p0018:             I have an informant among the slavers and I know the exact location of their secret meeting point! But I can't go there, if they see an official Order ship, they will just make themselves scarce and we won't get our man back!
$p0019:             Hey, you know what? You can actually help me! You should go there and pretend to be a slaver, or slave buyer or whatever. You can distract them while one of my men secretly approach them from behind - and together we'll give them hell! How's that for an idea?
$p0020:             Great! Here are the coordinates, and good luck!
$p0021:             Come on, we've got work to do! Head to the meeting point!
$p0022:             Thank you for your help, my friend! Here's your well-deserved reward.
$p0023:             And I'll put a word in for you in the Order.
$c0001:             I arrive precisely when I mean to.
$c0002:             Sorry, I was delayed.
$c0003:             Password!
$c0004:             Tetriandoch.
$c0005:             Swordfish.
$c0006:             KL32tUk0019... 123!
$c0007:             Ehm... Password?
$c0008:             ( engage them in battle )
$c0009:             Talk to me like that again and your body will be found in the garbage reprocessor.
$c0010:             I was about to leave. Sorry for bothering you.
$c0011:             What are you doing here anyway?
$c0012:             How do you know all that?
$c0013:             I'm in.
$c0014:             Too risky. Sorry.
$t0001:             Need help?
$t0002:             About kidnappers
$t0003:             Storekeeper
$t0004:             What now?
$t0005:             Slavers
$t0006:             Slavers
$q0001:             Kidnappers
$q0002:             Officer Gorth told me that the station storekeeper was kidnapped. Now I need to go to the secret meeting spot for the pirates and pretend to be a slaver. One of the Order ships will flank them and help me save the storekeeper.
$q0003:             I've successfully helped Officer Gorth rescue the kidnapped storekeeper.
$q0004:             I've killed all the Pirate kidnappers. Now I need to search for survivors inside the wreckages.
$q0005:             I've rescued the storekeeper. Now I should get back to the station.
$n0001:             Inventory is full
$n0002:             You cannot take a passenger on board. Your inventory is full.
$i0001:             Pirate Kidnapper
$i0002:             Pirate Lobino
$i0003:             Order battleship
