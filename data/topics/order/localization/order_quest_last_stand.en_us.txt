$p0001:             Our forces are already gathering in the %system% system. We're almost ready to deal the final blow to the Xengatarn.
$p0002:             We've taken heavy casualties during our raids and we've lost most of our anti-hive weapons. All ships equipped with those are now in %system%, trying to destroy Xengatarn hives.
$p0003:             I'm going there personally to command the Order forces and take my part in this battle. And you should too. Are you ready?
$p0004:             Then do what you have left to do here and then report to me.
$p0005:             Dismissed!
$p0006:             Great! I'm leaving %system% with some of my best men and heading towards %capital%.
$p0007:             Meet me at the rendezvous point in %system%. Don't be late!
$p0008:             Finally, you are here! Just in time!
$p0009:             We assembled a squadron of special anti-hive units, but unfortunately they were destroyed by a sudden attack of Xengatarn elite ships. We've managed to draw them back, but now we have no weapons against the hives.
$p0010:             It's up to you to destroy these hives. This system is extremely dangerous, and the Xengatarn are getting reinforcements almost every hour. Do not hesitate - these hives must be destroyed as soon as possible!
$p0011:             If you have any trouble - come back here. We will try to protect you.
$c0001:             I'm ready.
$c0002:             Let's kick Xengatarn arses!
$c0003:             I'm not ready yet.
$c0004:             Understood.
$c0005:             How's the situation?
$c0006:             Understood.
$t0001:             Final battle
$t0002:             Status report
$q0001:             Last stand
$q0002:             General Troyden with some of his men, including Sgt. Rangar, is moving to %system%, the Xengatarn capital. I should meet him there at the rendezvous point to get further orders.
$q0003:             I need to destroy all the hives in the %system% system.
$i0001:             General Troyden
$i0002:             Sgt. Ragnar
$i0003:             Officer Coldridge
