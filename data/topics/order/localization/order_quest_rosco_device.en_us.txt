$p0001:             I'm not sure. Are you a hacker?
$p0002:             Then no, I don't need your help.
$p0003:             But you've just said, that you're not a hacker!
$p0004:             Oh, okay then. I've just received this device from our scouts. It was used by the Fanatics. I studied it and I've come to the conclusion that this device is for data storage incorporating both human tech and some alien parts. Now I'm waiting for a team of our hackers to break into it.
$p0005:             But they are busy with another assignment and it will take them some time to finish it before they can help me. And if you're, as you say, such a good hacker yourself, maybe you can hack this device instead?
$p0006:             Okay, I guess I just have to wait for our hacker team after all.
$p0007:             Great! I have already connected it to the station terminal. You can use it to hack into the device.
$p0008:             Good luck!
$p0009:             Hacked the device yet? I'm eager to see what secrets it contains.
$p0010:             What?! Wait a second... You're not a hacker! You deceived me!
$p0011:             Get out of my sight!
$p0012:             You did? Great! I didn't doubt you for a second!
$p0013:             Here, take the money. It was compensation for the hackers' services, but now I have no need for that so I can safely pay for your help instead.
$p0014:             And I will definitely put a good word in for you to Sgt. Ragnar!

$q0002:             Scientist Rosco just received a device that belonged to the Fanatics. He needs my help to hack it. I should use the station terminal to hack this device.
$q0003:             I have successfully hacked the device and accessed protected files. I should report the result to Rosco as soon as possible.
$q0004:             I accidentally triggered an anti-hacking mechanism and ruined all stored data on the device. I should tell Scientist Rosco about that.
